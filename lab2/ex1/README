One router with two lan, both with 2 pcs. The assignment is: to
configure the topology to use static IPv6 addresses. 

You have to provide static GUA addresses to the machines in the topology.

- lan1 and lan2 must have the subnet 2001:DB8:CAFE:1::/64 and
  2001:DB8:CAFE:2::/64 respectively

- pc1, pc2, pc3 and pc4 must have in the Interface ID: 101, 102, 103 and
  104 respectively:
In PC* 
$ip addr add  2001:DB8:CAFE:1::10*/64  dev eth0      - for  GUA
$ip addr add fe80::10*/64 dev eth0 			         	 - for LinkLocal

- the router r1 has always 1 in the Interface ID of its own address,
  both link-local and GUA :
In R1:
$ip addr add fe80::1/64 dev eth0 (So i can $ping fe80::1%eth0 in another PC) - for link local
$ip addr add fe80::1/64 dev eth1 (So i can $ping fe80::1%eth1 in another PC) - for link local

$ip addr add 2001:DB8:CAFE:1::1/64 dev eth0 - for GUA
$ip addr add 2001:DB8:CAFE:2::1/64 dev eth1 - for GUA

We can't ping out the lan, we can reach only the host that belong at our network, 
	because the routing table doesn't have ip to send the packet ($ ip -6 r)
We must add the default gateway:
	$ip -6 route add default via fe80::1 dev eth0 (eg. in PC2,PC1)
Now if I ping PC3 ($ping 2001:DB8:CAFE:2::103) the packets recived by PC3 but PC1/PC2 doesn't see the reply
We must add the default router to PC3:
	$ip -6 route add default via fe80::1 dev eth0 (rg. in PC3,PC4)
