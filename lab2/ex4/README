One router with two lan, both with 2 pcs. The router is connected with
an ISP router.
The assignment is: to configure the topology to use IPv6 addresses.

The ISP makes use of a DHCPv6 server for address and prefix distribution.

The router has to ask prefixes to its ISP and has to distribute
addresses inside the two lans, using SLAAC.

You are supposed to configure a DHCPv6 client to make r1 asking for
prefix delegation and (optionally) for an address and to make router
advertisements with the received prefixes.

The ISP is already configure to provide prefixes, while the router and the
pcs have to be configured.

You can use dibbler+radvd or dhcp6c+dnsmasq.

- the router has always 1 in the host part of its own link local address.

- With dibbler, you will have to use a script to make router assigning an address to
  the interface in the network of the prefix. This will be used as the
  address radvd will advertise in the network for SLAAC configuration.


#DIBBLER+RADVD
- add sys information in lab.conf
- add radvd.conf in r1/ect to ra
- add dibbler.conf and dibbler-notify.script in r1/etc/dibbler to require ipv6 to ISP and assigned it
- add information in r1, to execute the script, the radvd deamon and the dibbler-client
- network ??? https://wiki.debian.org/IPv6PrefixDelegation
- set the alias in r1/etc/network/interfaces
