One router with two lans with two pcs. The assignment is: to configure the
topology to use SLAAC IPv6 addresses. The router is already configured to
advertise prefixes in both the lans.
(https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-configuring_the_radvd_daemon_for_ipv6_routers)

You should check the sysctl ipv6 settings. Sysctl write can only be done
in the lab.conf OR in a priviledged container.

Priviledge mode: $sudo kathara lstart --privileged -> with this command we don't have all terminal open
		but we must connect with them one by one. ($kathara connect pc*)

To change parameter in priviledge mode:
$ sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.addr_gen_mode=1
or also
$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/addr_gen_mode

Forwarding must be 0
If I want to forward my packets, I must assume that I am a router. So i don't suppose to accept router advertisment if
		i want act as a router
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding 
Function default: 
	accept_ra enable if forwarding disable and vice versa


- All the pcs of the topology must have GUA addresses.

- pc1, pc2 and pc3 have to use standard address.

- pc1 has to use the default configuration for the Interface ID

- pc2 has to use a Random Interface ID
	$ echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/addr_gen_mode

- pc3 has to use EUI-64

- pc4 has to use the privacy extension in order to make it use
  temporary addresses. Set up a short lifetime in order to see multiple 
  addresses. 
	$  echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use_tempaddr
	$ echo 600 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/temp_valid_lft 
	$ echo 300 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/temp_prefered_lft 

- router r1 is already set up. You only have to turn on the radvd server
  to capture the router advertisement packets. See the r1.startup file.

We can see that with router advertisment we receive also the default rute
